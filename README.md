## About this project

### Inspiration

My inspiration was only types of women empowerment and when I observed and compared it with the present scenario I found a mismatch. 

## What it does
It shows how to deal with cyberbullying and helpline numbers of different countries. It even defines existing types of women empowerment and provides some good resource names and links. It asks for donations and a payment gateway is integrated into it. It asks to fill a membership form and in the same, it provides an opportunity for volunteering, membership, and sharing your story. It publishes blogs of women who inspire every one of us.
